### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Malte â€” a tech enthusiast with a background in IT consulting and a growing passion for software development.

After nearly four years in IT consulting, I decided to shift gears and pursue a **Master's in Applied Computer Science**. My goal is to focus more directly on the technical side of problem-solving â€” designing and building solutions, not just recommending them.
